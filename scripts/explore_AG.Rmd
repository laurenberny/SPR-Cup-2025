Calibrate weights to standardize mean?
```{r}
summary(full$rep_weight_2)
```


survey package in R can handle weights
- use BRR variance estimation (another option is linearization/Taylor Series)

cross-sectional weights are specific to wave; single-wave is slightly different

we have cross-sectional

change in sample = use the all-waves weights
